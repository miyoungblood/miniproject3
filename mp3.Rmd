## Problem statement
```{r}
#Querying data for each rating using indices and joins
sql_r <- db %>%
  dbGetQuery("SELECT t.production_year, count(mi.info) AS R
             FROM title t
             JOIN movie_info mi ON t.id = mi.movie_id
             WHERE mi.info_type_id = 97
             AND mi.info LIKE '%Rated R%'
             AND t.production_year > 1967
             GROUP BY t.production_year;")
sql_pg13 <- db %>%
  dbGetQuery("SELECT t.production_year, count(mi.info) AS PG13
             FROM title t
             JOIN movie_info mi ON t.id = mi.movie_id
             WHERE mi.info_type_id = 97

             AND t.production_year > 1967

             JOIN movie_info mi ON t.id = mi.movie_id
             WHERE mi.info_type_id = 97
             AND mi.info LIKE '%Rated NC-17%'
             AND t.production_year > 1967
             GROUP BY t.production_year;")
sql_pg <- db %>%
  dbGetQuery("SELECT t.production_year, count(mi.info) AS PG
             FROM title t
             JOIN movie_info mi ON t.id = mi.movie_id
             WHERE mi.info_type_id = 97
             AND mi.info LIKE '%Rated PG%'
             AND t.production_year > 1967
             GROUP BY t.production_year;")
```
```{r}
#Compiling into one table
rating_counts <- sql_r %>%
  left_join(sql_pg13, by = "production_year") %>%
  left_join(sql_pg, by = "production_year") %>%
  left_join(sql_nc17, by = "production_year")
#Tidying
rating_counts2 <- rating_counts %>%
  gather(key = "Rating", value = "N", -production_year)
```
## DELETE I didn't use G rated movies because the data said there was a single movie in 2009 and that was it, so ratings start at pg-13
```{r, warning=FALSE}
#Making time series for movie counts
ggplot(rating_counts2, aes(x = production_year, y = N, color = Rating)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Production Year") + ylab("Number of Movies") +
  ggtitle("Number of Movies Rated Yearly") +
  theme_bw()
```
